# Description:
# The `seeds.rb` file contains the script for populating the database with 
# initial data. It is executed via `rails db:seed` and is essential for 
# setting up development or staging environments.
#
# Architecture:
# - Data: Defines creation of default records (currently empty/commented).
# ==============================================================================

# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
