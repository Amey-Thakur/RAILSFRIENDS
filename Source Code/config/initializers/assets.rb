# Description:
# The `assets.rb` initializer configures the asset pipeline parameters.
# It defines the version for asset expiry and manages additional load paths
# for static resources.
#
# Architecture:
# - Version: Sets the asset version string to force cache expiry.
# - Paths: Configures custom asset directories.
# ==============================================================================

# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Version of your assets, change this if you want to expire all your assets.
Rails.application.config.assets.version = "1.0"

# Add additional assets to the asset load path.
# Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Emoji.images_path

# Precompile additional assets.
# application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS in the app/assets
# folder are already added.
# Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( admin.js admin.css )
