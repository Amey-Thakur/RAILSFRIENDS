# Description:
# The `inflections.rb` file contains rules for the ActiveSupport Inflector.
# It allows the definition of irregular pluralization and singularization 
# logic to ensure domain-specific terminology is handled correctly.
#
# Architecture:
# - Locale: Defines rules for the English (:en) locale by default.
# ==============================================================================

# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, "\\1en"
#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, "\\1"
#   inflect.irregular "person", "people"
#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
# end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym "RESTful"
# end
