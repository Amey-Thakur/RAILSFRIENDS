# Description:
# The `Application` class defines the core configuration settings for the
# RAILSFRIENDS ecosystem. It acts as the central registry for framework 
# defaults, middleware integration, and engine loading.
#
# Architecture:
# - Framework: Loads `rails/all` (Active Record, Active Job, etc.).
# - Defaults: Initializes configuration for Rails 7.0.
# ==============================================================================

require_relative "boot"

require "rails/all"

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module Friends
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Initialize configuration defaults for originally generated Rails version.
    config.load_defaults 7.0

    # Configuration for the application, engines, and railties goes here.
    #
    # These settings can be overridden in specific environments using the files
    # in config/environments, which are processed later.
    #
    # config.time_zone = "Central Time (US & Canada)"
    # config.eager_load_paths << Rails.root.join("extras")
